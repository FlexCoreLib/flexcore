flexcore
========

Build fast computational graphs quickly using modern C++!

Flexcore is:
* A modern C++ library for dataflow programming based on C++14.
* Fast: FlexCore does not contain any hidden performance traps. The template based design does not hide the execution path behind unnecessary indirection and thus allows compilers to optimize the whole dataflow program.
A set of benchmarks is delivered with the library to back up our claims.
* Generic: FlexCore requires only minimal concepts from user defined types and algorithms.
* Robust:  FlexCore makes full use of the C++ type system to make it easy to write correct and hard to write incorrect code.
* Well tested: FlexCore is in production use for 3D point cloud scanners. An extensive suite of unit-tests is provided as well.

Usage
-----
See the [getting started](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) page.

Installation
------------
Flexcore uses a cmake based build system.
After cloning run:

    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update

To compile and install:

    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake -DFLEXCORE_ENABLE_TESTS=NO ..
    $ make install

The installation location can be customized in the usual cmake way:

    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<prefix>

On 32-bit platforms libraries will be placed in <prefix>/lib32, and on 64-bit
platforms in <prefix>/lib64.

To override the library dir suffix specify the variable -DLIB_SUFFIX= in the
call to cmake. The libraries will then be installed in
<prefix>/lib${LIB_SUFFIX}

To use flexcore in a cmake based project check the [usage](docs/USING.md) document.

To access the documentation in doxygen, execute doxygen from top level directory, not from /docs :

`doxygen docs/doxyfile`

Dependencies
------------
- C++14 compatible compiler (tested with GCC-5.2, Clang-3.6)
- Boost (>=1.54) - thread/log/system libraries

External libraries that are included as git submodules, are located under
/src/3rdparty. Currently, flexcore includes the following libraries:

- adobe stlab forest library - A generic C++ library for graph representation
- cereal - A C++11 library for serialization
